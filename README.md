# UAV-Strategic-Deconfliction
This project implements a strategic deconfliction system for UAV (drone) waypoint missions operating in shared airspace. It serves as a final authority to verify if a planned drone mission is safe to execute by checking for conflicts in space and time  against other dronesâ€™ flight trajectories.
